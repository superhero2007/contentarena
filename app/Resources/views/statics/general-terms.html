</li>
</ol><br />
<ol ><li><p>Content Arena provides the technical basis and know-how for the operation of the Platform. The Platform is a website for Registered Users, which provides a marketplace for Sport Media Rights and allows Registered Users to sell and/or buy Sports Media Rights. The Platform offers a trading environment on which the Sellers can create and publish digital Listings. The Listing(s) may comprise of Single Listing and/or Bundle Listings. As part of the Service, Content Arena also regularly promotes Listing or parts thereof within their newsletter. The Listings chosen by Content Arena for such promotion is in Content Arena’s sole discretion.</p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol start="2"><li><p>Listings are published on the Platform’s marketplace and can be seen and accessed by all Registered Users. The Seller can select the sales method, i.e. the way how listed Sports Media Rights can be acquired by Buyer(s) (i.e. either Fixed Fee or Bidding Method), (see Clause 7). Furthermore, Sellers and Buyers can enter into a License Agreement through the Platform (see also Clause 7). </p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol start="3"><li><p>Content Arena does not become a contractual party to the License Agreement. The License Agreement is concluded solely between Sellers and Buyers and will be executed and performed among the Sellers and Buyers. Content Arena generates a License Agreement in accordance with the Listing which intends to cover the common constellations for license agreements regarding audio-visual sports media rights. In case the Registered Users do not wish to use the pre-defined terms, Sellers may amendment relevant pre-defined standard clauses by adding terms and conditions in the relevant box provided during the Listing Process and Buyers may request Seller to make such amendments in the relevant boxes through the Messaging Tool. Furthermore Registered Users may specify certain criteria that form part of the License Agreement (such as quality standards of content provided, satellite information ect.) </p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol start="4"><li><p>Content Arena shall not be responsible and liable for any Listings and for the License Agreements concluded by Registered Users. Listings or other content posted by Registered Users on the Platform do not represent Content Arena’s opinion and Content Arena is, as a matter of principle, not obligated to inspect Listings or other content to verify their lawfulness, correctness and completeness.

Each User Account is assigned to a Company Account.

<br />
<ol start="2"><li><p>The Registration Data must be provided accurate and complete. The Applying/Registered User must maintain and immediately update the Registration Data in the User Account should the Registration Data provided change during the registration process and/or after registration. This applies in particular also to the winding up of a company and its insolvency or liquidation.</p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol start="3"><li><p>Content Arena may request further information and documents (such as VAT and registration number)in order to carry out various checks (including but not limited to validation of the application request, fraud and money laundering prevention checks) as it deems appropriate before issuing a Company and/or User Account. Any Applying User authorises Content Arena to use the Registration Data and other information and/or documents provided to perform the above checks in relation to its application. Content Arena or agents acting on its behalf may pass the Registration Data on to group companies, and other organisations (for example: credit registers, regulatory bodies, law enforcement agencies, etc.). Content Arena undertakes to use the Registration Data always in accordance with Content Arena’s Privacy Policy.</p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol start="4"><li><p>Content Arena reserves the right (i) to issue a Company and/or User Account subject to certain preconditions (e.g. payment of outstanding Commission Fees) at its sole discretion as well as (ii) to deactivate or delete a Company and/or User Account as per Clause 13. </p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol start="5"><li><p>Content Arena cannot fully verify the correctness and completeness of the information and data including the Registration Data provided by applicants and/or Registered Users and is not liable for the incorrectness or incompleteness of such data. </p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<ol start="5"><li><p>COMMISSION FEE</p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol ><li><p>Registered Users agree that any License Agreement(s) may entail a Commission Fee due to Content Arena for the use of the Platform/the Services to be paid by the Seller of a License Agreement. </p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<p>The Commission Fee is due in case the License Agreement </p>

<br />
<ul>
 <li><p>was concluded through the Platform; or </p>

 </li>
 <li><p>contains Sports Media Rights of Listings or parts thereof that were available on the Platform at any time during the last three month before signature of the License Agreement.</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<br />
<p>Hence, Seller acknowledges and agrees (i) that the Commission Fee may be due irrespective of whether the License Agreement was concluded through or outside the Platform or whether the Buyer is/was a Registered User or not as long as the License Agreement contains Sports Media Rights of Listings or parts thereof that were available on the Platform at any time during the above mentioned period and (ii) that Seller accordingly is bound to the Listings for a period of three moths also after deactivation / deletion.</p>

<br />
<ol start="2"><li><p>The Commission Fee shall comprise of 10% (ten percent) of the Consideration (License Fee, Technical Fee or other considerations) agreed in the License Agreement plus VAT (if applicable) and shall be paid by Seller to Content Arena after receipt of a proper invoice as per Clause 5.3. </p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol start="3"><li><p>Content Arena will issue an invoice to Seller in accordance with the payment schedule defined in the relevant License Agreement (Example: In case licensee/Seller have agreed to pay 20% of the Consideration with signature of the License Agreement, then the 20% of the Commission Fee shall also be due with signature of the License Agreement). Although the Commission Fee is effective with signature of the License Agreement and in accordance with the payment schedule of the License Agreement, Content Arena may not enforce its claim to a Commission Fee at its sole discretion in case Seller has not received a payment and Seller can prove to have taken serious measures to enforce the payment obligation of Buyer under the relevant License Agreement. In this case Seller shall (i) transfer all outstanding payment claims against the Buyer to Content Arena up to an amount of the Commission Fee due and (ii) provide Content Arena with all other necessary assistance and documents that enables Content Arena to enforce the payment against Buyer.</p>

</li>
</ol><br />
<ol start="4"><li><p>Unless longer payment periods are approved by Content Arena the payment of the Commission Fee shall be effected within 14 days from the date of invoice without cost and without any deduction to the account of Content Arena indicated on the invoice. Default in payment for more than 14 days constitutes a material breach of the User Agreement. Seller shall pay a late charge in an amount equal to 4% percent per annum of the unpaid Consideration (calculated in respect of the period during which the relevant payment was overdue), subject to the receipt of a respective payment reminder in which a payment deadline of 7 days is notified. Content Arena’s acceptance of any payment after this due date shall not constitute a waiver by Content Arena of any of its rights hereunder.</p>

</li>
</ol><br />

<br />
<p>7. CONCLUSION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN USERS</p>

<br />
<p>7.1. The conclusion of a License Agreement is dependent on whether the Seller chooses a Fixed Fee Method or a Bidding Method for its Listing. </p>

<p>Conclusion of a License Agreement based on a Fixed Fee Method</p>

<p>7.2. In case the Listing published via the Fixed Fee Method, the Seller is required to allocate a fixed fee plus VAT (if applicable) as Consideration in EURO or US Dollar for which he wishes to sell the Sports Media Rights.</p>

<br />
<p>7.3. Publishing an Listing with the Fixed Fee Method on the Platform represents a legally binding offer to conclude a License Agreement with any Buyer who accepts to pay the defined Consideration (fix fee). </p>

<br />
<p>7.4. To accept the Listings published via the Fixed Fee Method, the Buyer is required to submit his Digital Signature, and to confirm these GTC, the Privacy Policy and to click the “Submit” button. By clicking the “Submit” button the deal is closed and a legally valid and signed License Agreement between the Seller and the Buyer is concluded.</p>

<br />
<p>7.5. The signed License Agreement is stored in both Parties’ Company and User Account. Also, both Parties are notified via email on the closed deal. The signed License Agreement is attached to this email in pdf-format.</p>

<br />
<p>Conclusion of a License Agreement based on a Bidding Method</p>

<p>7.6. In case the Listing is offered via the Bidding Method, the publishing of the Listing by Seller constitutes an invitation to submit a legally binding offer by any Registered User (i.e. invitatio ad offerendum).</p>

<p>7.7. To submit a legally binding offer on an Listing that is published via the Bidding Method, Registered Users are required to enter a bid, to submit his Digital Signature, to confirm the GTC and the Privacy Policy and to click the “Submit“ button. The Seller will then be notified via email on the binding offer of the Buyer and is invited to accept or decline the bid. </p>

<p>7.8. In case the Seller accepts the bid, the deal is closed and a legally valid and signed License Agreement between the Seller and the Buyer is concluded. The signed License Agreement is stored in both Parties’ User Accounts. Both Parties are also notified via email on the closed deal. The signed License Agreement is attached to this email in pdf-format.</p>

<p>7.9. In case the Seller declines the bid, the Buyer is notified via email that the Seller has declined his offer and may submit an increase bid as per Clause 7.7.</p>

<p>7.10. Seller can choose the option within the Bidding Method to define a minimum price limit which has to be met in order for Buyers to make a valid offer to the Seller (hereinafter “Minimum Bid”). The Minimum Bid shall not constitute a legal binding offer by Seller and just gives an information to Registered Users that Seller will not sell the Sports Media Rights which are subject matter of the Listing below this Minimum Bid.</p>

<p>7.11. For the avoidance of doubt: Content Arena does not become a contractual party to the License Agreement. The License Agreement is concluded exclusively between the Registered Users (i.e. the Sellers and Buyers) (see Clause 2.3).</p>

<br />
<p>8. LIABILITY FOR USER CONTENT </p>

<br />
<p>8.1. Content Arena is not liable for the correctness, quality, completeness, reliability, type and category or the credibility of the Listing or content posted by Registered Users.

<br />
<p>9.5. Although Content Arena makes every effort to keep the Platform free from malware (such as viruses or Trojans) no guarantee can be given that the Platform does not contain viruses or other damaging elements.
